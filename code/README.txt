STARTUP:
1) Compile graph.py
2) Follow instructions on which subway system to use

OPTIONS:
G) See the Graph: 
	Create a graph of the subway system
D) Display a Congestion Map: 
	Use Dijkstra's to return a heat map of 
	congestion
A) Try Adding a New Edge:
	Add and Delete edges subway lines to see effect 
	on congestion
S) Run Simulation:
	Run Dijkstra's and congestion analysis
	iteratively to see how traffic changes
R) Recommend a Route:
	Use A* to recommend a route based on congestion
	analysis on a preliminary run of Dijkstra's
E) Change the Algorithm:
	Switch between Dijkstra's and A* or data
	structure used by Dijkstra's
Q) Exit:
